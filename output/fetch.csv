I was underwhelmed by the coding performance (running the 70B model on https://llama2.ai/).  It has consistently failed most of the very-easy prompts that I made up this morning.  I checked each prompt with ChatGPT 3.5, and 3.5 got 100% (which means these prompts are quite easy).  This result was surprising to me based on the discussion and articles I've read.  However, digging into the paper (https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/), the authors are transparent that the coding performance is lacking.

Are my observations consistent with the results others are getting?

I haven't had time to keep up with all the open-source LLMs being worked on by the community; are there any other models that approach even ChatGPT 3.5's coding performance? (Much less GPT 4's performance, which is the real goal.)"

Github: [https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool) 

Factool is a tool augmented framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Factool now supports 4 tasks:

* **knowledge-based QA**: Factool detects factual errors in knowledge-based QA.
* **code generation**: Factool detects execution errors in code generation.
* **mathematical reasoning**: Factool detects calculation errors in mathematical reasoning.
* **scientific literature review**: Factool detects hallucinated scientific literatures.

Abstract:

>The emergence of generative pre-trained models has facilitated the synthesis of high-quality text, but it has also posed challenges in identifying factual errors in the generated text. In particular: (1) A wider range of tasks now face an increasing risk of containing factual errors when handled by generative models. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly defined granularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidence available during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges in mind, in this paper, we propose FacTool, a task and domain agnostic framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review) show the efficacy of the proposed method.

3,[P] Chapyter: ChatGPT Code Interpreter in Jupyter Notebooks,91,15269v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15269v8/p_chapyter_chatgpt_code_interpreter_in_jupyter/,14,1689610332.0,"I recently made a new JupyterLab extension called [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) (ùêÇùê°ùêöts in Juùêèùê≤ùê≠ùêûùê´) that aims at solving many pain points when using other AI coding assistants. I want to share with y'all the tools as well as my thinkings while building this.

**What is Chapyter**

Chapyter is a JupyterLab extension that seamlessly connects GPT-4 to your coding environment. Here are the key features: 

* **Code generation from natural language and automatic execution**   
Simply adding the magic command `%%chat` at the beginning of the cell of a natural language description of the task, the code is generated and the results are shown in a few seconds.

https://i.redd.it/y7l0s9pf5hcb1.gif

* **Using coding history and execution output for code generation**  
By adding the `--history` or `-h` flag in generation, chapyter can use the previous execution history and outputs to generate the appropriate visualization for the loaded IRIS dataset.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7pu6cbug5hcb1.gif

* **In-situ debugging and code editing**  
The generated code might not be perfect and could contain bugs or errors. Since Chapyter is fully integrated into Jupyter Notebook, you can easily inspect the code and fix any errors or bugs (e.g., installing missing dependencies in this case) without leaving the IDE.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mz4n4qsh5hcb1.gif

* **Transparency on the prompts and AI configuration and allows for customization**  
We release all the prompts used in our library and we are working on easy customization of the used prompts and settings.
* **Privacy-first when using latest powerful AI**  
Since we are using OpenAI API, all the data sent to OpenAI will not be saved for training (see [OpenAI API Data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). As a comparison, whenever you are using Copilot or ChatGPT, your data will be somewhat cached and can be used for their training and analysis.

**Why did I build Chapyter?** 

* Sometimes, I want to have an AI agent to *take over* some coding tasks, i.e., generating and executing the code and showing me the results based on some natural language instruction.
* I want the AI agent to be fully integrated in my IDE such that it can provide context-aware support and I can easily inspect and edit the generated code. 
* I want transparency on how the code is generated (knowing the prompts) and want to customize the code generation sometimes
* I want to keep my code and data private as much and I am hesitant to upload any WIP progress code/data elsewhere.

Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, NONE of any existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT Code Interpreter can satisfy all of the above requirements. We include more details here in our [blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter). 

Please check our Github Repo [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) and our [latest blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter) for more details. Feel free to try it out and looking forward to your thoughts :)"

As many of you probably know Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (**RLHF**) was the core technique used to produce ChatGPT and similar AI assistants that followed. RLHF replaces human feedback in an RL schema with a **preference model** that is trained according to a dataset of human preferences.

**Anthropic** has devised an extension of this idea in which an AI model (rather than humans) is used to generate the data which ultimately trains the preference model. This method, called **Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback** uses a **""constitution""** to guide the feedback model in terms of what outputs are preferable to others.

I go over the research in [**How Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback Works**](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-reinforcement-learning-from-ai-feedback-works/). In short, the authors find that they are able to train a **non-evasive harmless agent** using a short constitution. The method is found to be **superior to RLHF**, and constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF models.

**AI Startup Hugging Face Is Raising Fresh VC Funds At $4 Billion Valuation**

Hugging Face is raising a new funding round that is expected to value the high-flying AI startup at $4 billion, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter tell Forbes.

The Series D funding round is expected to raise at least $200 million, two sources said, with Ashton Kutcher‚Äôs venture capital firm, Sound Ventures, currently leading an investor scrum. But cofounder and CEO Cl√©ment Delangue is shopping around as the company has received multiple offers this week, four sources added.

Delangue was expected to pick a preferred offer as soon as Friday, according to another source, who noted that the situation was still fluid, meaning no agreement has been reached, and the numbers involved could change. Several other sources, who asked to remain anonymous as they weren‚Äôt authorized to talk about the deal, said that Hugging Face could seek to raise more, as much as $300 million, while existing investors could still attempt to take the round in a last-minute bid. GV, the venture firm backed by Alphabet, and DFJ were said to be looking at the round, one source added.

Hugging Face didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment. GV declined to comment. Coatue, DFJ, Kutcher, and Lux also didn‚Äôt respond.

The anticipated funding is the latest exclamation point in a cash frenzy for promising AI companies, particularly those providing large-language models, or LLMs, that power them. Just over a year ago, Hugging Face raised $100 million in a Series C round led by Lux Capital; Coatue and Sequoia were new investors in that round, joining A.Capital Ventures and Addition. The company had attained a $2 billion valuation in that round despite taking in less than $10 million in revenue in 2021. Its revenue run rate has spiked this year and now sits at around $30 million to $50 million, three sources said ‚Äî with one noting that it had more that tripled compared to the start of the year.

Named after the emoji of a smiling face with jazz hands, Brooklyn-based Hugging Face has grown quickly by offering what Delangue has described as a ‚ÄúGitHub for machine learning.‚Äù It is a central company in a growing movement of AI models that are open sourced, meaning that anyone can access and modify them for free. Hugging Face makes money by charging for security and corporate tools on top of a hub of hundreds of thousands of models trained by its community of developers, including the popular Stable Diffusion model that forms the basis for another controversial AI unicorn, Stability AI. (On Thursday, a Stability AI cofounder sued CEO Emad Mostaque, alleging he was tricked into selling his stake for next to nothing.) Per a Forbes profile in 2022, Bloomberg, Pfizer and Roche were early Hugging Face customers.

Earlier this year, Delangue warned that model providers reliant on paying huge sums to Big Tech‚Äôs cloud providers would function as ‚Äúcloud money laundering.‚Äù But training and maintaining models ‚Äî and building enterprise-grade businesses around them ‚Äî remains costly. In June, Inflection AI raised $1.3 billion, in part to manage its Microsoft compute and Nvidia hardware costs; the same month, foundation model rival Cohere raised $270 million. Anthropic, maker of the recently-released ChatGPT rival Claude 2, raised $450 million in May. OpenAI closed its own $300 million share sale in April, then raised $175 million for a fund to back other startups a month later, per a filing. Adept became a unicorn after announcing a $350 million fundraise in March. Stability AI, meanwhile, met with a number of venture firms in the spring seeking its own new up-round, industry sources said.

At a $4 billion valuation, Hugging Face would vault to one of the category‚Äôs highest-valued companies, matching Inflection AI and just behind Anthropic, reported to have reached closer to $5 billion. OpenAI remains the giant in the fast-growing category, Google, Meta and infrastructure companies like Databricks excluded; while its ownership and valuation structure is complex, the company‚Äôs previous financings implied a price tag in the $27 billion to $29 billion range.

Speaking for another Forbes story on the breakout moment for generative AI tools, Delangue predicted, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs potential for multiple $100 billion companies.‚Äù"

I‚Äôm using chatgpt to complete tasks for me. The prompt I‚Äôm using is really long and eventually errors. I‚Äôve shortened the prompt and it‚Äôs okay but I‚Äôd really like to be able to provide longer prompts. 

Initially I was looking into fine-tuning but that looks like it‚Äôs more to improve the results, not extend the context of the model. I‚Äôve read some stuff about positional interpolation.

I'm really curious to know what the community thinks as I've searched a lot and found a lot of clashes in opinions regarding what models are considered superior over others and the clickbait-ish talks and titles about model so-and-so being ""The ChatGPT Killer"".

It's pretty well known that LLMs have firmly established themselves as leaders in the field of natural language processing, consistently pushing the limits of language comprehension and generation, which is widely acknowledged.

I spent a little time playing around with few-shot prompting for OpenAI's Davinci model and I discovered that noisy data still has drastic effects even on powerful LLMs like Davinci.

I wrote up a [quick article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/07/ensuring-reliable-fewshot-prompt-selection-llms.html) in KDNuggets that shows how I used data-centric AI to automatically clean the noisy few-shot examples pool in order to achieve more accurate predictions. The resulting few-shot prompt with accurately labeled examples produced **20% fewer errors** than the original one with mislabeled examples.

GV, the venture firm backed by Alphabet, and DFJ were said to be looking at the round, one source added.

Hugging Face didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment. GV declined to comment. Coatue, DFJ, Kutcher, and Lux also didn‚Äôt respond.

The anticipated funding is the latest exclamation point in a cash frenzy for promising AI companies, particularly those providing large-language models, or LLMs, that power them. Just over a year ago, Hugging Face raised $100 million in a Series C round led by Lux Capital; Coatue and Sequoia were new investors in that round, joining A.Capital Ventures and Addition. The company had attained a $2 billion valuation in that round despite taking in less than $10 million in revenue in 2021. Its revenue run rate has spiked this year and now sits at around $30 million to $50 million, three sources said ‚Äî with one noting that it had more that tripled compared to the start of the year.

Named after the emoji of a smiling face with jazz hands, Brooklyn-based Hugging Face has grown quickly by offering what Delangue has described as a ‚ÄúGitHub for machine learning.‚Äù It is a central company in a growing movement of AI models that are open sourced, meaning that anyone can access and modify them for free. Hugging Face makes money by charging for security and corporate tools on top of a hub of hundreds of thousands of models trained by its community of developers, including the popular Stable Diffusion model that forms the basis for another controversial AI unicorn, Stability AI. (On Thursday, a Stability AI cofounder sued CEO Emad Mostaque, alleging he was tricked into selling his stake for next to nothing.) Per a Forbes profile in 2022, Bloomberg, Pfizer and Roche were early Hugging Face customers.

Earlier this year, Delangue warned that model providers reliant on paying huge sums to Big Tech‚Äôs cloud providers would function as ‚Äúcloud money laundering.‚Äù But training and maintaining models ‚Äî and building enterprise-grade businesses around them ‚Äî remains costly. In June, Inflection AI raised $1.3 billion, in part to manage its Microsoft compute and Nvidia hardware costs; the same month, foundation model rival Cohere raised $270 million. Anthropic, maker of the recently-released ChatGPT rival Claude 2, raised $450 million in May. OpenAI closed its own $300 million share sale in April, then raised $175 million for a fund to back other startups a month later, per a filing. Adept became a unicorn after announcing a $350 million fundraise in March. Stability AI, meanwhile, met with a number of venture firms in the spring seeking its own new up-round, industry sources said.

At a $4 billion valuation, Hugging Face would vault to one of the category‚Äôs highest-valued companies, matching Inflection AI and just behind Anthropic, reported to have reached closer to $5 billion. OpenAI remains the giant in the fast-growing category, Google, Meta and infrastructure companies like Databricks excluded; while its ownership and valuation structure is complex, the company‚Äôs previous financings implied a price tag in the $27 billion to $29 billion range.

Speaking for another Forbes story on the breakout moment for generative AI tools, Delangue predicted, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs potential for multiple $100 billion companies.‚Äù"

Blog: [https://ethanc111.github.io/factool\_website/](https://ethanc111.github.io/factool_website/) 

Github: [https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool) 

Factool is a tool augmented framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Factool now supports 4 tasks:

* **knowledge-based QA**: Factool detects factual errors in knowledge-based QA.
* **code generation**: Factool detects execution errors in code generation.
* **mathematical reasoning**: Factool detects calculation errors in mathematical reasoning.
* **scientific literature review**: Factool detects hallucinated scientific literatures.

Abstract:

>The emergence of generative pre-trained models has facilitated the synthesis of high-quality text, but it has also posed challenges in identifying factual errors in the generated text. In particular: (1) A wider range of tasks now face an increasing risk of containing factual errors when handled by generative models. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly defined granularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidence available during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges in mind, in this paper, we propose FacTool, a task and domain agnostic framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review) show the efficacy of the proposed method.

23,[P] Chapyter: ChatGPT Code Interpreter in Jupyter Notebooks,91,15269v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15269v8/p_chapyter_chatgpt_code_interpreter_in_jupyter/,14,1689610332.0,"I recently made a new JupyterLab extension called [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) (ùêÇùê°ùêöts in Juùêèùê≤ùê≠ùêûùê´) that aims at solving many pain points when using other AI coding assistants. I want to share with y'all the tools as well as my thinkings while building this.

**What is Chapyter**

Chapyter is a JupyterLab extension that seamlessly connects GPT-4 to your coding environment. Here are the key features: 

* **Code generation from natural language and automatic execution**   
Simply adding the magic command `%%chat` at the beginning of the cell of a natural language description of the task, the code is generated and the results are shown in a few seconds.

https://i.redd.it/y7l0s9pf5hcb1.gif

* **Using coding history and execution output for code generation**  
By adding the `--history` or `-h` flag in generation, chapyter can use the previous execution history and outputs to generate the appropriate visualization for the loaded IRIS dataset.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7pu6cbug5hcb1.gif

* **In-situ debugging and code editing**  
The generated code might not be perfect and could contain bugs or errors. Since Chapyter is fully integrated into Jupyter Notebook, you can easily inspect the code and fix any errors or bugs (e.g., installing missing dependencies in this case) without leaving the IDE.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mz4n4qsh5hcb1.gif

* **Transparency on the prompts and AI configuration and allows for customization**  
We release all the prompts used in our library and we are working on easy customization of the used prompts and settings.
* **Privacy-first when using latest powerful AI**  
Since we are using OpenAI API, all the data sent to OpenAI will not be saved for training (see [OpenAI API Data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). As a comparison, whenever you are using Copilot or ChatGPT, your data will be somewhat cached and can be used for their training and analysis.

**Why did I build Chapyter?** 

* Sometimes, I want to have an AI agent to *take over* some coding tasks, i.e., generating and executing the code and showing me the results based on some natural language instruction.
* I want the AI agent to be fully integrated in my IDE such that it can provide context-aware support and I can easily inspect and edit the generated code. 
* I want transparency on how the code is generated (knowing the prompts) and want to customize the code generation sometimes
* I want to keep my code and data private as much and I am hesitant to upload any WIP progress code/data elsewhere.

Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, NONE of any existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT Code Interpreter can satisfy all of the above requirements. We include more details here in our [blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter). 

Please check our Github Repo [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) and our [latest blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter) for more details. Feel free to try it out and looking forward to your thoughts :)"

As many of you probably know Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (**RLHF**) was the core technique used to produce ChatGPT and similar AI assistants that followed. RLHF replaces human feedback in an RL schema with a **preference model** that is trained according to a dataset of human preferences.

**Anthropic** has devised an extension of this idea in which an AI model (rather than humans) is used to generate the data which ultimately trains the preference model. This method, called **Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback** uses a **""constitution""** to guide the feedback model in terms of what outputs are preferable to others.

I go over the research in [**How Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback Works**](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-reinforcement-learning-from-ai-feedback-works/). In short, the authors find that they are able to train a **non-evasive harmless agent** using a short constitution. The method is found to be **superior to RLHF**, and constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF models.

**AI Startup Hugging Face Is Raising Fresh VC Funds At $4 Billion Valuation**

Hugging Face is raising a new funding round that is expected to value the high-flying AI startup at $4 billion, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter tell Forbes.

The Series D funding round is expected to raise at least $200 million, two sources said, with Ashton Kutcher‚Äôs venture capital firm, Sound Ventures, currently leading an investor scrum. But cofounder and CEO Cl√©ment Delangue is shopping around as the company has received multiple offers this week, four sources added.

33,[P] Chapyter: ChatGPT Code Interpreter in Jupyter Notebooks,90,15269v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15269v8/p_chapyter_chatgpt_code_interpreter_in_jupyter/,14,1689610332.0,"I recently made a new JupyterLab extension called [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) (ùêÇùê°ùêöts in Juùêèùê≤ùê≠ùêûùê´) that aims at solving many pain points when using other AI coding assistants. I want to share with y'all the tools as well as my thinkings while building this.

**What is Chapyter**

Chapyter is a JupyterLab extension that seamlessly connects GPT-4 to your coding environment. Here are the key features: 

* **Code generation from natural language and automatic execution**   
Simply adding the magic command `%%chat` at the beginning of the cell of a natural language description of the task, the code is generated and the results are shown in a few seconds.

https://i.redd.it/y7l0s9pf5hcb1.gif

* **Using coding history and execution output for code generation**  
By adding the `--history` or `-h` flag in generation, chapyter can use the previous execution history and outputs to generate the appropriate visualization for the loaded IRIS dataset.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7pu6cbug5hcb1.gif

* **In-situ debugging and code editing**  
The generated code might not be perfect and could contain bugs or errors. Since Chapyter is fully integrated into Jupyter Notebook, you can easily inspect the code and fix any errors or bugs (e.g., installing missing dependencies in this case) without leaving the IDE.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mz4n4qsh5hcb1.gif

* **Transparency on the prompts and AI configuration and allows for customization**  
We release all the prompts used in our library and we are working on easy customization of the used prompts and settings.
* **Privacy-first when using latest powerful AI**  
Since we are using OpenAI API, all the data sent to OpenAI will not be saved for training (see [OpenAI API Data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). As a comparison, whenever you are using Copilot or ChatGPT, your data will be somewhat cached and can be used for their training and analysis.

**Why did I build Chapyter?** 

* Sometimes, I want to have an AI agent to *take over* some coding tasks, i.e., generating and executing the code and showing me the results based on some natural language instruction.
* I want the AI agent to be fully integrated in my IDE such that it can provide context-aware support and I can easily inspect and edit the generated code. 
* I want transparency on how the code is generated (knowing the prompts) and want to customize the code generation sometimes
* I want to keep my code and data private as much and I am hesitant to upload any WIP progress code/data elsewhere.

Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, NONE of any existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT Code Interpreter can satisfy all of the above requirements. We include more details here in our [blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter). 

Please check our Github Repo [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) and our [latest blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter) for more details. Feel free to try it out and looking forward to your thoughts :)"

As many of you probably know Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (**RLHF**) was the core technique used to produce ChatGPT and similar AI assistants that followed. RLHF replaces human feedback in an RL schema with a **preference model** that is trained according to a dataset of human preferences.

**Anthropic** has devised an extension of this idea in which an AI model (rather than humans) is used to generate the data which ultimately trains the preference model. This method, called **Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback** uses a **""constitution""** to guide the feedback model in terms of what outputs are preferable to others.

I go over the research in [**How Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback Works**](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-reinforcement-learning-from-ai-feedback-works/). In short, the authors find that they are able to train a **non-evasive harmless agent** using a short constitution. The method is found to be **superior to RLHF**, and constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF models.

36,[N] HuggingFace reported to be reviewing term sheets for a funding round that could raise at least $200M at a valuation of $4B.,174,155f2k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/155f2k0/n_huggingface_reported_to_be_reviewing_term/,33,1689919178.0,"Link to article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/07/13/ai-startup-hugging-face-raising-funds-4-billion-valuation/

**AI Startup Hugging Face Is Raising Fresh VC Funds At $4 Billion Valuation**

Hugging Face is raising a new funding round that is expected to value the high-flying AI startup at $4 billion, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter tell Forbes.

The Series D funding round is expected to raise at least $200 million, two sources said, with Ashton Kutcher‚Äôs venture capital firm, Sound Ventures, currently leading an investor scrum. But cofounder and CEO Cl√©ment Delangue is shopping around as the company has received multiple offers this week, four sources added.

Delangue was expected to pick a preferred offer as soon as Friday, according to another source, who noted that the situation was still fluid, meaning no agreement has been reached, and the numbers involved could change. Several other sources, who asked to remain anonymous as they weren‚Äôt authorized to talk about the deal, said that Hugging Face could seek to raise more, as much as $300 million, while existing investors could still attempt to take the round in a last-minute bid. GV, the venture firm backed by Alphabet, and DFJ were said to be looking at the round, one source added.

Hugging Face didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment. GV declined to comment. Coatue, DFJ, Kutcher, and Lux also didn‚Äôt respond.

The anticipated funding is the latest exclamation point in a cash frenzy for promising AI companies, particularly those providing large-language models, or LLMs, that power them. Just over a year ago, Hugging Face raised $100 million in a Series C round led by Lux Capital; Coatue and Sequoia were new investors in that round, joining A.Capital Ventures and Addition. The company had attained a $2 billion valuation in that round despite taking in less than $10 million in revenue in 2021. Its revenue run rate has spiked this year and now sits at around $30 million to $50 million, three sources said ‚Äî with one noting that it had more that tripled compared to the start of the year.

Named after the emoji of a smiling face with jazz hands, Brooklyn-based Hugging Face has grown quickly by offering what Delangue has described as a ‚ÄúGitHub for machine learning.‚Äù It is a central company in a growing movement of AI models that are open sourced, meaning that anyone can access and modify them for free. Hugging Face makes money by charging for security and corporate tools on top of a hub of hundreds of thousands of models trained by its community of developers, including the popular Stable Diffusion model that forms the basis for another controversial AI unicorn, Stability AI. (On Thursday, a Stability AI cofounder sued CEO Emad Mostaque, alleging he was tricked into selling his stake for next to nothing.) Per a Forbes profile in 2022, Bloomberg, Pfizer and Roche were early Hugging Face customers.

Earlier this year, Delangue warned that model providers reliant on paying huge sums to Big Tech‚Äôs cloud providers would function as ‚Äúcloud money laundering.‚Äù But training and maintaining models ‚Äî and building enterprise-grade businesses around them ‚Äî remains costly. In June, Inflection AI raised $1.3 billion, in part to manage its Microsoft compute and Nvidia hardware costs; the same month, foundation model rival Cohere raised $270 million. Anthropic, maker of the recently-released ChatGPT rival Claude 2, raised $450 million in May. OpenAI closed its own $300 million share sale in April, then raised $175 million for a fund to back other startups a month later, per a filing. Adept became a unicorn after announcing a $350 million fundraise in March. Stability AI, meanwhile, met with a number of venture firms in the spring seeking its own new up-round, industry sources said.

At a $4 billion valuation, Hugging Face would vault to one of the category‚Äôs highest-valued companies, matching Inflection AI and just behind Anthropic, reported to have reached closer to $5 billion. OpenAI remains the giant in the fast-growing category, Google, Meta and infrastructure companies like Databricks excluded; while its ownership and valuation structure is complex, the company‚Äôs previous financings implied a price tag in the $27 billion to $29 billion range.

Speaking for another Forbes story on the breakout moment for generative AI tools, Delangue predicted, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs potential for multiple $100 billion companies.‚Äù"

I‚Äôm using chatgpt to complete tasks for me. The prompt I‚Äôm using is really long and eventually errors. I‚Äôve shortened the prompt and it‚Äôs okay but I‚Äôd really like to be able to provide longer prompts. 

Initially I was looking into fine-tuning but that looks like it‚Äôs more to improve the results, not extend the context of the model. I‚Äôve read some stuff about positional interpolation. 

This isn‚Äôt my area of expertise so was wondering if some LLM guru might be able to point me in the right direction. Thanks!"

I'm really curious to know what the community thinks as I've searched a lot and found a lot of clashes in opinions regarding what models are considered superior over others and the clickbait-ish talks and titles about model so-and-so being ""The ChatGPT Killer"". 

With all this info in consideration, what model(s) do you ACTUALLY use the most? I'd be grateful if you shared your thoughts about this issue and thanks for your time."

It's pretty well known that LLMs have firmly established themselves as leaders in the field of natural language processing, consistently pushing the limits of language comprehension and generation, which is widely acknowledged.

I spent a little time playing around with few-shot prompting for OpenAI's Davinci model and I discovered that noisy data still has drastic effects even on powerful LLMs like Davinci.

[mislabeled few-shot examples harms LLM performance drastically](https://preview.redd.it/st5c6w0i1ycb1.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=41116a2e302c08ea23729be0bc56ae06928fda3b)

I wrote up a [quick article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/07/ensuring-reliable-fewshot-prompt-selection-llms.html) in KDNuggets that shows how I used data-centric AI to automatically clean the noisy few-shot examples pool in order to achieve more accurate predictions. The resulting few-shot prompt with accurately labeled examples produced **20% fewer errors** than the original one with mislabeled examples.

This one was quite eye-opening for me and I hope you find it is as interesting as I did. Let me know what you think!"

It works pretty  well, if I get a stupid answer from ChatGPT I can wait a bit longer and  receive very pertinent answers fetched from the posts and an organic  neurons work.

It is funny that we  complained about using ChatGPT to answer people on forum, and now it is  ChatGPT that query people to find ready-made answers.

Right now working on a filter to prevent my plugin from scrapping people answers that might not be organic but made in GPT."

I'm thinking about writing a program that will act as a proxy between me and the server. The program would use OpenAI's API to understand commands and questions, generate code, shell commands, and configuration files, and then be able to execute commands and read/write files on the server.

For example, it could convert a tutorial from the internet into a series of commands that can be executed on the server. It will always ask for permission before executing any command or writing any file.

My question is, do you think this is a good idea? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"

My project might just be the perfect solution for you!

Behold the independent version of Code Interpreter - customizable to add any language or dependency as per your requirements. Not limited to Python anymore, explore the vivid world of various coding languages.

This project leverages Jupyter to execute code safely within a Docker container. What's more? You can effortlessly retrieve files from the container with easily generated download links, pretty much like the original Code Interpreter from OpenAI.

However, I must confess I'm not a frontend designer at heart. It would be an absolute delight if there's anyone who could uplift the user interface - the ambition is to mirror something akin to the aesthetic of the ChatGPT website.

I eagerly await your valuable contributions and inputs! Here's the link to the project - dive in, explore, and help make it better!

I have created a new fine-tune model based on the base 'davinci' model and want to fine-tune it on Java language as an experiment. Having said that, don't want to go on for hours to generate 100-1000's of prompts and responses. Is there a readily available dataset that can use or any other approach to do this? tried asking chatgpt but it only gives 10. also tried feeding it a pdf (text+code) for training but was not successful. The base model is difficult to work with, as it's declared as legacy. Ihad given 20 prompts/responses when I created the fine-tune but the output it generates is pure garbage. Figured need to give more input for training. Also, do need to also train it on sentiment and other text? Or just Java should be fine?

I'm thinking about writing a program that will act as a proxy between me and the server. The program would use OpenAI's API to understand commands and questions, generate code, shell commands, and configuration files, and then be able to execute commands and read/write files on the server.

For example, it could convert a tutorial from the internet into a series of commands that can be executed on the server. It will always ask for permission before executing any command or writing any file.

My question is, do you think this is a good idea? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"

I'd like to take the first steps on what an AI is, what problems it solves etc. But starting with a more practical way, like software engineer approach.... Is it possible ?

My idea would be to approach it in a practical way so that if I were to like it then I would then start studying all the math behind it to know how the models work and why they behave the way they do.

How do you recommend that I get started ?

To give language models the ability to process both text and image data we need to train these multimodal data which is usually very expensive.

My relationship with AI is as consumer user... I used ChatGPT, Dall-E, and other similar generative AI... I'm impressed by these technology but I'm impressed more and more by the fact that under the hood is all math and engineering... 

I'd like to take the first steps on what an AI is, what problems it solves etc. But starting with a more practical way, like software engineer approach.... Is it possible ?

My idea would be to approach it in a practical way so that if I were to like it then I would then start studying all the math behind it to know how the models work and why they behave the way they do.

How do you recommend that I get started ?

I find myself somewhat bewildered about it because it is new to me and I wouldn't know where to look....

Thanks to those who can help me."
